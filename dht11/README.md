A program demonstrating how to take measuremenets with an analog temperature and humidity sensor. It is assumed that the sensor is connected to the BCM pin 17 (physical pin11) of the Raspberry Pi.

The code is based on old [Adafruit's work](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT).

You can find the datasheet for DHT11 [here](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf).
